## Abstract
This application allows users to play a terminal based game in the command line, where users will be asked basic level questions about JavaScript. Users will answer in a multiple choice style format and feedback will be given based on correct or incorrect answers. At the end of the flashcard set, users will be prompted to try and answer incorrectly answered questions again. Once all questions have been answered correctly, a percentage score will be given based on the number of tries it took to guess correctly!
